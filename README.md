# grid_inventory
Grid based inventory subsystem

Heavily inspired by/borrowed from (Grid Inventory with Patterns)[https://github.com/alpapaydin/Godot-4-Grid-Inventory-with-Patterns], originally by alpapavdin. I reworked most of it because I am A) a masochist, B) want to keep my coding skills alive, and C) wanted to better familiarize myself with how the system works.
